Purpose:
	JNI Test: Java -> calls C++ -> that invoke a java callback
	This time the C++ access and manipulate JAVA bytes arrays
	
Details:
	The C++ native access 3 JAVA bytes arrays.
	it performs bitwise OR for the 1st 2 arrays and store the result in the 3rd array.
	then, JAVA check the result *in two places*.
	The 1st JAVA check may print ERROR in case JVM duplicated the memory (OK - otherwise)
	The 2nd JAVA check "must" print OK, because it will be safe even in case the memory is duplicated

for building it, type:
	make
	OR, make clean all
	
	
for running it, type:
	make test
