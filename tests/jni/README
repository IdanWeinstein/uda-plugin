Purpose:
	JNI Test: Java -> calls C++ -> that invoke a java callback
	
Details:
	Java class that - upon load - calls native C++ library for registering a java function as callback
	As a result, The C++ calculate once the ID of the JAVA callback and keep it for future use
	Later, the "JAVA Main" invokes C++ native function that calls the registered java callback
	NOTE: no args are passing at this phase (except for 'this' object from the java calling class)
	

for building it, type:
	make
	OR, make clean all
	
	
for running it, type:
	make test
OR:
	JDK=/usr/lib/jvm/java-1.6.0-openjdk-1.6.0.0.x86_64/ # NOTE: this should match appropriate variable in Makefile
	export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=. 
	$JDK/bin/java JniTest
